# All-Hazard-Incident-Management-Team
I am a retired National Registry Paramedic with 42 active years in the field. I am looking to see if this platform will assist me in writing an App for Incident Management (hurricanes, large disasters), as I have been deployed over the last 19 years to assist municipalities and states with Incident Management.
